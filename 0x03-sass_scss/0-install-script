##Installation Anywhere (with Node.js already installed)
 This method is more general and can be used if you already have a compatible version of Node.js installed on your system.

1. Verify Node.js Installation: 
Ensure you have Node.js and npm available in your terminal.
 -node -v
 -npm -v

2. Install SASS:
Run the npm command to install the SASS compiler version 3.7.4.
npm install sass -v 3.7.4
